Hi there! I am a doctoral student focusing on system security for highly distributed systems, especially the security of Edge-AI services running as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). My work aims to develop secure solutions for cloud-edge continuum. My research interests include `system security`, `distributed systems`, and `Edge-AI`.

I hold a M.Sc. (with [MEXT](https://www.mext.go.jp/en/policy/education/highered/title02/detail02/sdetail02/1373897.htm) scholarship) from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology([NAIST](https://www.naist.jp/en)), Japan, where I studied jitter in containerized networking for future compute fabrics. I also have a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Tezpur Central University ([TU](https://www.tezu.ernet.in)), India.

My experience includes roles as Staff Engineer at [Ovvy](https://ovvy.ai) (USA), Research Assistant at [ICSCoE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/en/about/org/icscoe/index.html) (Japan), and Visiting Researcher at [ADSLab](https://cloudresearch.org) (Umeå University, Sweden). I worked with Prof. [Youki Kadobayashi](https://iplab.naist.jp/members/youki/) and Dr. [Yuzo Taenaka](https://taenaka.net/index-en.html) in the Laboratory for Cyber Resilience at NAIST, Japan, as well as with Dr. [Ryota Kawashima](https://researcher.nitech.ac.jp/html/100000308_en.html) in the SDN Lab at Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan. Currently, I am working in [Autonomous Distributed Systems Lab.](https://cloudresearch.org) under the guidance of Dr. [Monowar Bhuyan](https://people.cs.umu.se/monowar/) and Prof. [Erik Elmroth](https://people.cs.umu.se/elmroth/).
