I am a researcher interested in system software, networking, and distributed systems. I completed my a Master's degree at the [Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Japan](https://www.naist.jp/en), focusing on `assessing the readiness of containerized networking functions for future compute-inter-connect fabric`. I have a 4-year general Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Tezpur Central University, India.](https://www.tezu.ernet.in/)

Professionally, I have experience working as a Remote Staff Engineer at [Ovvy](https://ovvy.ai) in Delaware, USA, where I led a team in developing AI models for automating real estate image editing and it's operations. I also serve as a Research Assistant at [ICSCoE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/en/about/org/icscoe/index.html) in Japan, working on core network technology and cybersecurity solutions & training. My past experience includes a role as a Visiting Researcher at [ADSLab](https://cloudresearch.org) in Ume√• University, Sweden, where I contributed to projects on network anomaly detection.

My research interests include `system software`, `networking` and `distributed systems`, and I have published several papers in these areas. I have received a full scholarship of `3.5 million JPY` from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [(MEXT)](https://www.mext.go.jp/en/policy/education/highered/title02/detail02/sdetail02/1373897.htm) in Japan, recognizing academic and research potential. I am committed to advancing technology through collaboration and continuous learning.
